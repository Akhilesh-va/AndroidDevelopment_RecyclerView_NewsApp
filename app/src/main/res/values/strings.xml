    <string name="news">A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck southern Japan early Sunday morning, causing widespread panic and significant structural damage. The tremor, which hit at 3:45 AM local time, was centered 50 kilometers off the coast of Kyushu Island at a depth of 20 kilometers. Authorities have issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas, urging residents to evacuate to higher ground as waves as high as three meters are expected. Initial reports suggest multiple buildings have collapsed in the city of Kagoshima, with power outages affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Emergency response teams have been deployed, and the military is on standby for rescue operations. Hospitals in the region are overwhelmed with injured victims, and local authorities have declared a state of emergency. Public transportation, including trains and flights, has been halted as officials assess the damage to infrastructure. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida addressed the nation, urging calm and ensuring swift action for relief and recovery efforts. This earthquake comes just weeks after a series of smaller tremors in the region, raising concerns about aftershocks and further seismic activity. The full extent of the damage and casualties is still being assessed as rescue operations are underway.</string>
